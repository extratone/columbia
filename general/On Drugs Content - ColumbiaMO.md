# On Drugs Content - ColumbiaMO
While I technically never specified drugs-related content to be against the rules, I’ve got to take it down because this is a **public, locally-specific group chat**. It’s not like the cops to be smart enough to look, but implying you have drugs for sale technically implicates you when there’s a location involved, even if you weren’t planning an actual hand off.
