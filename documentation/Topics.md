From [**Telegram's blog post**](https://telegram.org/blog/topics-in-groups-collectible-usernames):

> ### Topics in Groups
> 
> Telegram groups can support huge communities with hundreds of thousands of users. To keep these chats easy to read, groups with **over 200 members** can now **enable topics** and create separate spaces for any subject.
> 
> Topics function as **individual chats** within the group â€“ supporting their own **shared media** and **notification settings**. Members are free to chat in any topic from _Anime_ to _Zoology_, using all their favorite features like [polls](https://t.me/TelegramTips/207), [pinned messages](https://t.me/TelegramTips/302) and [bots](https://t.me/telegram/195).
> 
> This feature is intended specifically for **large groups**, adding new ways to customize their chats and promote discussion. Later this year, we expect to introduce a different set of tools, tailored to **small groups**. If you want to give topics a test drive, try them out in this [public group](https://t.me/TheForum).
> 
> > Group admins can enable topics in their _Group Settings_, and can control who is allowed to **create and manage topics** in _Permissions_.
> 
> As with anything on Telegram, further updates will bring more powerful tools for both admins and users of this feature.
