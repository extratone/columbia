Howdy, folks!

This is a semi-formal announcement, I suppose.

I've created a very simple Telegram bot (@[ColumbiaMOBot](https://telegram.me/ColumbiaMOBot)) in the interest of perhaps adding some more utility to this group, especially considering how quiet the humans have been, lately.

I am very much open to suggestions/requests/help in terms of adding functionality to the bot, going forward. 

Initially, all I've done is (temporarily, if need be) added [the RSS feed](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo.rss) for [the columbiamo subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo), which means (as currently configured,) you'll be seeing the bot post links to all new threads in said subreddit fairly promptly after they are submitted.

I'm going to respond as soon as I can to this message with an anonymous poll regarding this specific addition - please do vote honestly. The results will determine whether or not autoposting from this one subreddit continues.

(I've just peeked at the feed contents, themselves, in an RSS reader, and honestly it doesn't seem lively enough to be disruptive, but I guess we'll see.)

Also! For documentation's sake, [here's the issue on the group's GitHub Repository regarding the bot's development](https://github.com/extratone/columbia/issues/14).
